angularstore
============

eStore is an Angular JS application started for a presentation at my firm. This is an inmemory store that has few books; the intent is to cover the Angular JS directives, routers, data binding, ngSanitize, modularity etc.,

Accompanying presentation is in slideshare.net - http://www.slideshare.net/ganeshkondal/tech-io-spaangularjs20130814v095

eStore applications' logical next steps include 

a) moving the controller to its own folder.
b) instead of hardcoded books list in BooksService.js, get it from the backend via a REST call.  REST calls can be made with $resource OR using $http.  $resource is the appropriate one.
c) Also check on $q and promises; when using $resource. 


All the best. Lets Code !!!

Feel free to reach me for any questions, comments on the code / presentation done.
